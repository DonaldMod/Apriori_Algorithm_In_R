## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Load the necessary libraries
```{r}
# Load the necessary libraries
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)

# Define the transactions
transactions <- as(
  list(
    c("Bread", "Chips", "Eggs", "Drink"),
    c("Bread", "Chips", "Drink"),
    c("Bread", "Milk", "Yoghurt"),
    c("Bread", "Drink", "Milk"),
    c("Chips", "Drink", "Milk")
  ),
  "transactions"
)

```


# Run the Apriori algorithm
```{r}
# Run the Apriori algorithm
rules <- apriori(transactions, parameter = list(supp = 0.5, conf = 0.8))


```
# Inspect the rules

```{r}
# Inspect the rules
inspect(rules)

```
# Visualize the rules

```{r}
# Visualize the rules
plot(rules, method = "graph")

```

```{r}
write(rules)

```

# Plot the item frequencies
```{r}
# Plot the item frequencies
itemFrequencyPlot(transactions, topN = 5, type = "absolute", main = "Grocery Frequency")
```
