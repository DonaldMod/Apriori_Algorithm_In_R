## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Load the necessary libraries
```{r}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)

transactions1 <- as(
  list(
    c("A", "B", "C"),
    c("A", "B"),
    c("A", "C"),
    c("A", "D"),
    c("B", "C")
  ),
  "transactions"
)
```

# Run the Apriori algorithm
```{r}
rules1 <- apriori(transactions1, parameter = list(supp = 0.4, conf = 0.6))

```

# Inspect the rules

```{r}
summary(rules1)
```

```{r}
inspect(rules1)

```

```{r}
write(rules1)

```

# Plot the item frequencies
```{r}
# Plot the item frequencies
itemFrequencyPlot(transactions1, topN = 4, type = "absolute", main = "Alphabet Frequency")
```
