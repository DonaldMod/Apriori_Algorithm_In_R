## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(arules)
transactions3 <- as(
  list(
    c("HD", "B", "Ke"),
    c("HD", "B"),
    c("HD", "Co", "Ch"),
    c("Co", "Ch"),
    c("Ch", "Ke"),
    c("HD", "Co", "Ch")
  ),
  "transactions"
)

```

```{r}
rules2 <- apriori(transactions3, parameter = list(supp = 0.3334, conf = 0.6))

```

```{r}
inspect(rules2)

```

```{r}
library(arulesViz)

itemFrequencyPlot(transactions3, topN = 5, type = "absolute", main = "Chemical Frequency")

```
